# Part I — Foundations of Network Modeling
*Notes based on my understanding of the lecture material.*

## 1. What Is a Network Model?

A **network model** describes how a network is generated.  
Formally, it specifies a probability distribution over all possible networks:

> P(X; θ), with X in the set of all possible networks 𝓧.

Where:

- X is a network (often represented as an adjacency matrix)  
- θ are model parameters  

A good network model helps answer:

- Why does a network look the way it does?  
- Which mechanisms shape its structure?  
- How do micro-level decisions create macro-level network patterns?  

Network models can be:

- **Descriptive** — summarizing structure  
- **Generative** — simulating networks with specific properties  
- **Inferential** — testing hypotheses about mechanisms  

---

## 2. Stylized Network Models

Stylized models are simplified generative models used to illustrate how simple mechanisms create global network patterns.  
They help link micro rules with macro structures.

### 2.1 Erdős–Rényi Random Graphs (ER)

Assumptions:

- Each dyad forms **independently**  
- All dyads have the **same probability p** of having a tie  

Consequences:

- Randomly distributed ties  
- Narrow degree distribution  
- Low clustering  
- Very few triangles  
- Unrealistic compared to social networks  

**Use case:** baseline or null model.

---

### 2.2 Regular Lattice

Nodes are arranged in geometric space and connected to neighbors.

Characteristics:

- High clustering  
- Very long path lengths  
- No degree variation  
- Unrealistic for social networks  

---

### 2.3 Small-World Networks (Watts–Strogatz)

Process:

1. Start with a lattice  
2. Randomly rewire a small proportion of edges  

Outcomes:

- High clustering  
- Short path lengths (“small-world effect”)  
- Still not realistic degree variation  
- Weak community structure  

---

## 3. CUG Tests (Conditional Uniform Graph Tests)

CUG tests evaluate whether an observed network statistic is unusual relative to a null model.

### 3.1 When to use CUG tests?

To test whether observed structure is “too high” or “too low” compared to random networks, for example:

- Reciprocity  
- Density  
- Number of triangles  
- Clustering coefficient  

### 3.2 How CUG works

1. Choose a null model (e.g., fix density or degree sequence).  
2. Generate many random networks under that null.  
3. Compute the statistic for each simulated network.  
4. Compare the observed statistic to the null distribution.  

### 3.3 Interpretation

If the observed value lies in a tail of the null distribution:  

- It is unlikely to arise by chance.  
- This suggests underlying structural mechanisms beyond the constraints of the null model.

## 4. Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP)

QAP tests **dyadic associations** while accounting for network autocorrelation.  
Because dyads are not independent, standard regression is invalid.

### 4.1 Bivariate QAP

Given:

- X: dependent network  
- Z: predictor network or dyadic variable  

Steps:

1. Compute an association between X and Z (e.g., correlation or regression coefficient).  
2. Permute node labels repeatedly to generate reshuffled versions of the network.  
3. Recalculate the association for each permutation.  
4. Compare the observed value to the permutation distribution.  

This produces valid p-values under dyadic dependence.

---

### 4.2 Multiple Regression QAP (MR-QAP)

Allows multiple predictors:

> logit( P(X_ij = 1) ) = θ₀ + θ₁ Z₁,ij + … + θ_k Z_k,ij.

Permutation techniques:

- **Freedman–Lane residual permutation**  
- **Double semi-partialling (Dekker et al.)**  

These strategies handle collinearity among predictors and give more reliable p-values.

---

### 4.3 Why MR-QAP is useful

- Handles non-independent dyads.  
- Tests homophily, role effects, proximity, multiplexity.  
- Coefficients are easy to interpret.  
- More flexible than simple CUG tests.  
- Useful as an exploratory method before ERGM/SAOM.

---

## 5. Typical Hypotheses in QAP

Examples:

- **Homophily:** same office or same school → higher probability of a tie.  
- **Multiplexity:** friendship ties → higher probability of an advice tie.  
- **Role effects:** seniority differences → directional advice patterns.  
- **Proximity:** same group or department → collaboration ties.  

These ideas are encoded as dyadic matrices used as predictors in QAP.

## 6. Key Takeaways from Part I

- Stylized models reveal how simple rules can produce complex network structures.  
- CUG tests evaluate whether observed structure is surprising under a chosen null model.  
- QAP handles dyadic dependencies and allows hypothesis testing on networks.  
- MR-QAP supports multivariate modeling with permutation-based inference.  
- These foundations prepare the ground for:
  - **ERGMs (Part II)**  
  - **SAOMs (Part III)**
