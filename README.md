# Network Modeling Coursework (Fall 2024)

This repository contains my personal code and notes from a graduate-level **Network Modeling** course at ETH Zürich.  
The focus of the coursework is on applying statistical and computational methods to analyze social network structures and their dynamics using R.

## Covered Methods

The practical exercises in this repository involve:

- **QAP regressions** for dyadic network data
- **Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)**
- **Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOMs)** for longitudinal network evolution
- Basic network visualization and exploration with R

These methods are widely used in computational social science, sociology, communication research, and related fields.
